# P5 - Debug and optimize a photographer's website

For this educational project, I assumed the role of a freelance developer, offering my SEO optimization services to Nina Carducci, a photographer. The website had a few bugs and was not well optimized.

To begin, I addressed the existing bugs, particularly in the gallery where the functionality of next and previous images was not working. Following this, I generated Lighthouse and GTmetrix reports to pinpoint areas for improvement. Subsequently, I enhanced performance, accessibility, and SEO aspects. I incorporated Open Graph metadata and schema.org microdata for local referencing. For performance tracking, I integrated Google Search Console and Google Analytics.
